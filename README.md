# Imputing Interactions
R code to compare multiple imputation approaches for a logistic regression model containing an interaction which is formed of a partially observed binary variable and a fully observed binary variable. 

The multiple imputation approaches are compared within different scenarios where the prevalance of stage is 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50%. 

During the analysis, 1000 simulations were used for a data set of 100,000 observations and 10 iterations and 10 imputations were used for each multiple imputation approach.
